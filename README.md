Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Delphi 10.1 on a project named SistemaEco
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development(React, node.js, scss, typescript)
- 👯 I’m really want to collaborate on web projects because on my studies with web development I'm fell very excited when i saw the things that I can do on web.
